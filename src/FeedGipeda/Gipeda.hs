      The strings @{{rev}}@ and @{{base}}@ are replaced by the full SHA hashes of
      the two commits to compare.

      the scope of gipeda in projects with a large history.
  -}

  {-^ A glob (as understood by git tag -l) specifying which tags should be
      shown on the main page. By default, no tags are shown; use * to show all.
  -}
  , interestingBranches :: String
  -- ^ A glob such as @interestingTags@, but for selecting branches.

  {-^ A shell command to execute in the directory for benchmarking.
      Should produce CSV data in the format expected by gipeda.

  {-^ A file glob that determines to what benchmarks these settings apply.
      @match: "*"@ will apply these settings to all benchmarks,
      @match: "regression/*"*@ only to those whose title starts with
      @regression/@.
  -}
  , smallerIsBetter :: Maybe Bool
  {-^ By default (or if this is @False@), gipeda assumes that greater number
      indicate improvement, and smaller number indicate regressions
      (e.g. requests per second). This inverts this logic (e.g. runtime).
  -}
  , unit            :: Maybe String
  -- ^ Arbitrary unit, to be printed in the tables and on the graph axes. Defaults to @""@.
  , type_           :: Maybe String
  {-^ @"float", @"integral"@ (default) or @"small integral". For the first two,
      differences are expressed in percentages (+10%), while for the latter,
      differences are expressed in differences (+2). This is more suitable for
      numbers like test suite failures, which should usually be zero or very
      small.
  -}
  , group           :: Maybe String
  {-^ The benchmarks are displayed in groups; all benchmarks that have the same
      string here are grouped under this title. Defaults to @""@.
  -}
  , threshold       :: Maybe Double
  {-^ Any change by a percentage greater than this number is flagged as a
      regression resp. improvement; anything below this number is considered to
      be a boring result, and not highlighted separately.
  -}
  , important       :: Maybe Bool
  {-^ @True@ by default. If @False@, a regression in this benchmark will not be
      included in the summary for the whole commit. Use this if you have very
      volatile tests that would produce too much noise on the main page.
